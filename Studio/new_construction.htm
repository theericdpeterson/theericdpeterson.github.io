<p>Please excuse me while I just ramble ... This is just going to read like a
journal and I don't have time to re-write/organize the information.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I believe that I have an ideal location for a studio: under my garage. The previous owner of
our home put in stairs, exterior double solid-core doors, connected it to the home's alarm
system, and turned the space into a 26' by 22' woodshop.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0123_small.jpg" width="300" height="450"></p>
<p>We live on a hill, so the garage floor is supported on big glue-laminated
beams and 2&quot; by 12&quot; joists on 8&quot; centers. The floor has two
inches of light weight cement poured over 3/4&quot; plywood.&nbsp; Additionally,
half of the room has some cement walls on three sides and is partially underground due to the
location on the hill. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0104_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>The space was divided by a wall which we demolished, as you can see in the
pictures above.&nbsp; Half of the room was a non-standard height, so we dug down
and set up to pour a footing. We lowered the floor by 20&quot;.&nbsp; </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0117_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"> </p>

<p>The pump truck arrived and we did the pour.&nbsp; </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0113_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"> </p>

<p>What a mess! :-) You can't see it in the picture, but the new footing has a
water channel molded into the top that is about 1&quot; deep and 3&quot; wide
that runs the entire perimeter. Should any water seep/leak into the area, it
will have a clear path to the crawlspace below that does not include my new
floor.&nbsp; </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0112_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"> </p>

<p>Then the forms came off, we stuck in a vapor barrier, and started hanging
floor joists. The
live/tracking room above the new floor will be a room within a room design with
a floating ceiling. </p>

<p> Note that the new floor is isolated from the existing floor. This
is by design to isolate the control room from the live/tracking room.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We got a chance to test hits theory out when the air compressor for the framing
nail gun kicked in while resting on one of the floors.&nbsp; The floor the
compressor was resting on vibrated like crazy, but the other floor wasn't moving
at all; cool!&nbsp; </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0105_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>My little helper and I strung nylon line under the joists and put 9&quot; of
insulation in the floor. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0101_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I routed conduit for audio cables and Romex for the in-floor power receptacles.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0091_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>Speaking of insulation, the garage is starting to look pretty scary! The floors and ceilings are going to be R-25, the 6&quot; walls of the live/tracking
room are going to be R-21, and the thinner 4&quot; wall are going to be R-15.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0103_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>That's a rather daunting pile of 2 X 6's that will make up the live/tracking
room walls. On the left is about 1200 pounds of Pergo flooring. You should have
seen me try to move that mountain on the cart at Costco, it did not even want to roll!&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0102_small.jpg" width="300" height="450"> </p>
<p>This mountain of MDF &amp; soundboard (below) is destined for the walls and
ceiling of the studio.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0189_smaller.jpg" width="594" height="396"> </p>
<p>As you can see the existing duct work was in the way of everything and was
going to cause me grief. See how it passes under the glue-laminated beam? It was
going to be a problem in both rooms.&nbsp; </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0096_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>So, we changed the HVAC ducts to insulated flexible tubing. (modeled below)
We actually fixed a problem with the HVAC system and now the bonus room and the
kitchen are getting heated and cooled better than ever before since the volume
of air has been double to these rooms.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0093_small.jpg" width="300" height="450"></p>

<p>Some of the flex ducts were stuffed into the overhead space in-between the 2&quot; X
12&quot; roof joists, and some of them when over the beam. It's hard to tell
from the picture below, but al of the big white ducts have been removed which
freed up a lot of space in the room.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Well, the floor is in place now, both floor are finally at the same level. It is three layers: a 3/4&quot; plywood base,
1/2&quot; sound board, 1/2&quot; high density MDF. We screwed down the MDF with cabinetry
screws, it's not going anywhere! Ultimately it will have
1/4&quot; maple Pergo over the MDF. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0127._small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>I got a new toy today that's going to pay for itself rather quickly; it's a
laser square. I just used it when I drilled and bolted&nbsp; the&nbsp; 2 X 6
base plates onto the foundation to square it up. It projects perfect XYZ axes.
Pretty cool! You can't tell from the picture below, but it's also shooting a
beam straight up. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0126_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>I spent the entire weekend under the crawlspace. &lt;yuck&gt;&nbsp; When I
emerged I looked like chimney sweep!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I figured out why the floor would bounce &amp; squeak, the previous owner had
never properly attached the beams to the 4 X 4 posts, or the posts to the cement
pads. After a few hours of work the floor was nice and solid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I added the all-important vapor barrier because, believe it, or not, there
wasn't one in place.</p>
<p>I stuck 9&quot; of insulation in-between the joists of the existing floor.</p>
<p>Then, I suspended the remaining flexible HVAC duct from the joists with
fiberglass strapping. Moving this duct from ceiling of the room above to this
under-floor configuration freed up a lot of real-estate in the room. </p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/Picture_0187_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>Before I placed the last bit of insulation in the floor, I prepped the floor
accept boxes for XLR floor plates (rear below) and one brass in-floor power
outlet and pre-routed Romex to it.&nbsp; I used my router to make cut-outs for
the box mounting ears, so they are flush now with the underlayment. </p>
<p>These three floor boxes will be inside of my current ISO booth when the room
is done. This will be nice as I won't have cables everywhere. like I do now. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0188_small.jpg" width="300" height="450"></p>
<p>This weekend my brother Kent and I moved the dryer duct and a bathroom vent
duct so they hugged the walls instead of running straight down the center of the
future live/recording room.&nbsp; It was little more work than we bargained for,
but it worked perfectly first time. :-)&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0234_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0235_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>Well, it's always something, eh? It turned out that the builder of our home
did not run the hot water heater overflow tubing outside. He routed it right
into the crawlspace.&nbsp; I couldn't very well wall it in because if it ever
blew, I'd have 80 gallons of hot water all over my studio.&nbsp; So, I picked up
30 feet of 3/4&quot; copper tubing and all the fittings. Then I fired up the
torch and silver-soldered up some custom plumbing.. I routed the tubing under
the floor of the studio and out the side wall of the house.&nbsp; You can't
really see much in the picture below.&nbsp; Prior to my doing the plumbing, that
copper pipe just stuck straight out of the wall. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0280_small.jpg" width="300" height="450"></p>

<p>The next thing I tackled was the interface between the furnace room and the
Live room.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since I don't want the sound in the Live room to leak into the HVAC system, I
decided to box in and insulate the ducts that will be immediately behind the
wall. This also helped to reduce the roar of the furnace directly on the other
side of the wall.</p>

<p>I had to work around a few obstacles, so I fir-ed out the studs with 2 X 2's
and made sure to protect the natural gas line (yellow flex tube below) with the
metal protectors so I couldn't stick a nail through it accidentally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MDF box in the picture below is a home-made duct for the combustion air
for the gas furnace. There's actually a small vent on the wall next to the
furnace, so this duct is much larger and getting sufficient air should not be an
issue.&nbsp; The idea was to keep any direct sounds from shooting straight
through the vent cover. Now the sound has to turn a corner before it can go
in/out of the furnace room. Hopefully that will help.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0285_small.jpg" width="300" height="450"></p>

<p>As you can see I boxed in the HVAC ducts and applied soundboard and/or MDF to
the wall.&nbsp; I was just using up scraps so it was kind of random as to what I
used where.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I had finished the job, one of the kids turned on the light in the
furnace room and I realized that there was a 3/8&quot; gap between the 2X6 stud
and the foundation that the light was shining right through. Sound would be able
to travel right through that, so I grabbed some expanding foam spray and filled
the gap. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0284_small.jpg" width="300" height="450"><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0283_small.jpg" width="300" height="450"></p>

<p>The next thing I tackled was the interface between the Live Room and the
outside. I really don't want to drive the neighbors crazy, so I grabbed some
3/4&quot; plywood and nailed it to the 2X6 studs.&nbsp; I closed up the
foundation vent with a plywood/insulation/plywood sandwich and caulked it. </p>

<p>In the process of covering this wall I located the place where I will run
conduit down from the garage circuit breaker panel and left that section
uncovered. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0281_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>It's looking like I'm **finally** ready to do some framing here. So, maybe
the next set of pictures will be more interesting. </p>

<p>My Markertek order arrived today! Woo Hoo! Look at those spools of Star Quad
microphone cable... </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0317_small.jpg" width="300" height="450"></p>

<p>All of the brushed stainless wall plates arrived too.&nbsp; I ordered just
enough to get me by, the rest of the wall boxes will be provisional pre-wired
inside the walls, but will just have the cheaper blank wall plates on
them.&nbsp; </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0315_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>So, I did some framing last week and I was able to get to a point where I was
close to finishing the two closets and the nook for my <a href="images/Smaller_Picture_0628.jpg"> existing ISO booth.</a>
The nook is between the two closets, and the ISO booth will just slide right in.
All of the cables will be floor boxes; pretty cool! The left closet will have an
access hatch to the crawlspace, and will have the breaker sub-panel for the
studio in it. I'll probably use this for guitar cases, etc.&nbsp; The right hand
closet will be my machine closet where all of the extra wires, etc will live, as
well as my DAW PC.&nbsp; </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0333_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>The PC will be in it's own ISO box below (Oops! I tilted the camera ..) This
will be MDF and foam lined.&nbsp; A small fan and some 4&quot; ducting will
bring fresh&nbsp; air in and out of the crawlspace. In theory, I won't hear my
PC anymore, yes!&nbsp; I routed Ethernet and power connections to the back of
the box, and it will have it's own little under the cabinet fluorescent light
inside so I won't require a flashlight.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0332_small.jpg" width="300" height="450"></p>

<p>My friend Rick Gould came down from Seattle with his family to give me a
hand. What a boost! Rick built his own house and knew all of the tips/tricks to
get things done fast.&nbsp; In one long weekend we framed up the entire
performance room using 2X6 studs including the roof-within-a-roof joists. Thanks
Rick! :-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's a view of the inside of the performance room. The three bays on the
wall are 5' wide and will be recessed 1' and will have 3 guitar hangers in each
with a curio cabinet style light in each bay. I haven't decided how tall to make
them, so the bottoms are open for now. I will box them in later when I figure it
out.&nbsp; Note that these are load bearing walls.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0325_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>Here's a view from the control room looking in the future window.<a name="Older Window Frame"></a> </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0330_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>Here's a view from the far corner of the performance room. That's my old
sleeper couch, which will stay in this room. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0324_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>Here's a view from the couch. You probably can't make it out, but there are
two small boxes on the lower left and right of the rear wall pre-wired for
speakers. That's where I'll stick my good Dahlquist speakers; in my simulated
living room! It didn't take long to route the wires, because it's a room within
a room design, almost every wire can safely be attached to the outside of the
studs. It's going to be nice not having cables everywhere. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0326_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>Here's a shot of the floating ceiling. My brother Kent worked his tail off
stuffing fiberglass insulation in between the existing floor joists and the new
roof joists; thanks Kent! :-) I wired the roof for track lighting last Saturday,
so that's out of the way. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0323_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>I'm just working on the last few walls and the entryway/stairs now. I should
have pictures soon. </p>

<p>Wow! It's great to have friends. I had help the last two weekends in a
row.&nbsp; This past weekend reminded&nbsp; me of a barn raising. Dale, Rick,
and Pat all drove down from Seattle to help. We got a lot done. Thanks guys! :-) </p>

<p>Dale helped me with the wiring and he got the subpanel wired in using four #6
wires, and a 60A breaker in the main panel. We also added a 20A circuit using
#10 wire in the garage above the studio for shop tool power. We routed conduit
along the wall and behind the tools. What a difference that made! The compressor
no longer blows the breaker and the table saw will actually cut without bogging down. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0379_small.jpg" width="300" height="450"> </p>

<p>Pat helped me with the guitar nook framing. The compressor finally working came in handy when Pat mentioned that he had
his air framing nail gun in his truck. He made mincemeat out of the guitar nook
framing task, and they are done and ready to wire. You can't tell from this picture,
but I routed flex ducting along the wall below the ledges in the nooks. I'm
looking forward to hanging up my guitars in the nooks. </p>

<p>You can't see the ducting for the dryer or the bathroom vent since they are
mostly obscured by framing along the top of the wall. Now I will be able to
stuff insulation in and around the ducts to acoustically isolate them a bit form
the room. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0377_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"> </p>

<p>Rick helped me with the entryway. We decide on a 45 degree opening so as
to minimize the amount of the room dedicated to it, and also so it
matched the theme of the rest of the house. The new shop power came in handy
when I had to rip a 2X4 at a 45 degree angle for Rick to use on the corners. My table saw just kept going and
going and going.... pretty cool!&nbsp; I routed the flex ducts over and under
the new entryway.&nbsp; You can see the air vent near the lower left of the
opening. The opening will not have door at first, but the opening width is set
for adding a 48&quot; inner door in the future should I want and air-lock type
entry. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_0381_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"> </p>

<p>What a mess we made! I guess that's the price of productivity. I was so tired
Monday it was all I could do to just clean up the mountains of sawdust, and wood
scraps, and to get organized. Most of my tools were buried. With the framing 98%
done, I decide to move out all of the lumber as well.&nbsp; What a difference!
Now I'm not tripping over a tangle of extension cords and lumber, and slipping
on sawdust piles. As soon as I wrap up the details on the computer ISO box, I
will focus on the wiring. </p>

<p>Well, it has been a while since I have written. The twins (Ryan and Rachel)
arrived!!! :-) Needless to say, the studio project, and just about everything else, came to a
grinding halt. The twins are now 3 months old. Where did the time go?&nbsp;They've
started to baby talk this past week, they are adorable! Wow! I'm a daddy!&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1478_small.jpg" width="297" height="198"></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1315_cropped.jpg" width="300" height="293"></p>

<p>I decide to tackle the problem of tapping into the house telephone system.
Luck was with me. The phone outlet in the bonus room lined up exactly on the
stud wall of my left closet. So, I was able to punch through&nbsp; with a
12&quot; drill bit right into the stud and tap into the wiring from there. It
doesn't get much better than that. The telephone lines are all in and working.
One two-line outlet under the window, one in the performance room, and one in
the back of the computer ISO box for use in internet connectivity via the phone
line network interface card. You can see the phone jacks in the picture below.
The first time the phone rang out there I answered. &quot;Studio A, how may I
direct your call&quot;. :-)&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1582.jpg" width="300" height="450"></p>

<p>Next I decided to tackle the problem of routing mouse/keyboard, and video
cables from the mixing location under the window, and from the solo control
setup inside my ISO booth. I routed 4&quot; conduit under the floor: from the
computer ISO box to the mixing station, and to the ISO recording booth. You can
see the two conduit's sticking up in the bottom left of the ISO box above.</p>

<p>You can see the conduit that terminates inside the ISO booth below, it's
right next to the in-floor power outlet. The <a href="images/Smaller_Picture_0629.jpg">remote
control station</a> will be right in front of the floor power and conduit
sitting at a 45 degree angle.&nbsp;Pretty cool!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/Picture_1574.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>You can see where the other conduit terminates under the window in the
picture below.&nbsp; It will be behind the main mixing position desk.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1575.jpg" width="600" height="900"></p>

<p>Because the computer can't run very long without overheating in a closed box,
I need to solve the problem of cooling air for the computer when the door to the
ISO box is closed. I needed to pull cold air out (pictures below) of the crawlspace into the box,
and to exhaust the hot air from the ISO box to the crawlspace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/Picture_1576.jpg" width="600" height="900"><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1588.jpg" width="300" height="450"></p>

<p> My first attempt
was pretty comical. I used two standard A/C mini-fans and insulated 4&quot;
ductwork. It sounded like a shop vacuum! Arghh! It was almost worse than the
sound of the PC I was trying to squelch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did some research and found an ultra quiet Panasonic bathroom ceiling fan
capable of 75 CFM. So, I bought one (after listening to it run)&nbsp; and
mounted it into the ceiling of the DAW ISO box. I made a floating mount using
MDF and foam tape, so it's actually not in direct contact with the box. This
eliminated the mechanical coupling of vibration noise.&nbsp; I screwed a
temporary door over the box opening, and verified that it was in fact pumping
air through the box&nbsp; a decent rate. This time when I powered it up, it was
virtually silent. When the insulation goes up and the sheetrock is on, I won't
here my PC at all. No more 777 on take-off noise at the mixing position for
me!&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1583.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>I also stuck a small fluorescent light (above) in the ISO box so I could
easily work on my PC w/o getting a flashlight.&nbsp;Ultimately this will be
lined with acoustic foam, but that doesn't need to be done before the sheetrock
goes up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had a week off from work due to a plant shutdown, and I was determined to get as much done as I could.
My friend Rick Gould came down yet again to lend a very capable hand, thanks
Rick!&nbsp;
</p>

<p>We decided to tackle the A/C electrical wiring and got it to the point where
it was 99% there. As you can see from the picture below, the breaker subpanel is
now fully populated.&nbsp;
</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1564.jpg" width="600" height="900">
</p>

<p>The light boxes are now in ceiling of the guitar nooks and wired to a switch
by the door.&nbsp;
</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1597.jpg" width="594" height="396">
</p>

<p>We routed provisional circuits for the better than average 220V Hydronic (oil
filled) Baseboard heaters: one per room complete with thermostat boxes. That's
the orange wire you see below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1568.jpg" width="600" height="900"></p>

<p>We stuck lots of outlets under the mix position and along the walls:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1587.jpg" width="600" height="900"></p>

<p>While Rick was wiring up the A/C in the control room, I worked to wire up the
audio cables everywhere. I created a hub where the audio cables will emerge to
the left of the window right behind my Mackie SR2404 mixing board. I am using
Star-Quad cabling because it has the best shielding available in my price range.
I bought little tape number tags, and I&nbsp; am labeling them as I go to
minimize my pain later when the cables need to be soldered up.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1570.jpg" width="600" height="900"></p>
<p>It's starting to look like the inside of a 777 electronics bay down here!
:-)&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1569.jpg" width="600" height="900"></p>
<p>I wired up the in-floor XLR audio and headphone jack cables to the audio hub.
These will be in the floor of the <a href="images/Smaller_Picture_0632.jpg">ISO
recording booth</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1572.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I wired up the drums position in-wall XLR audio and headphone jack cables to
the audio hub. The drums will be at the far end of the room opposite the
couch.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1594.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I wired up the guitars position in-ceiling XLR audio and headphone jack
cables to the audio hub. The guitar positions will be between the drums and the
couch. Wouldn't you know it? The floating ceiling made my life difficult. I had
to custom build box mounts and install them.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1561.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1562.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>At each guitar position I will suspend <a href="images/Smaller_Picture_0632.jpg">inverted
mic stands like I did in the ISO booth</a>. Again, no more cables under my feet,
cool!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also added some pass through boxes to go between the two rooms.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1591.jpg" width="600" height="900"></p>
<p>The remaining audio wiring includes:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Drum overhead &amp; room mic boxes.</li>
  <li>Performance speaker wire boxes for my JBL's</li>
  <li>Maybe a conduit pass-through for future needs still unknown.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>My brother Kent came down (thanks again Kent!) this past weekend and we made
some headway installing insulation in the ceiling of the control room. It's
quite a bit of work since the beams are on 8&quot; centers and each piece of insulation
needs to be cut lengthwise to fit. </p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p>Well, it's been about 6 weeks since I've been able to do anything, but I made
some progress today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wired the headphone cabling for the drums position to the headphone patch
bay in the control room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created another ceiling mount (below) and cabled up a dual mic box directly
over the center of the drums position. These will be used for the&nbsp; drums
overhead mics. Since it was a single-gang box I didn't have to do anything fancy
this time to mount it. Yeah!&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1876_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I had some extra mic cable and an extra single gang box, and I didn't know
what to do with them. Then I got inspired. I cabled two mic lines to the back
wall of the guitar nook immediately next to the couch.&nbsp; My thinking was
that it would be nice to have someone sit on the couch and to have my guitar FX processor
sitting on the shelf and also a direct box. Recording from he couch might be
kind of relaxing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1875_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I also added yet another 4 mic cable pass through box from the control room
to the performance room. I figured it couldn't hurt to have too many.</p>
<p>I then started thinking about my performance rack and powered JBL speakers. I
carried them into the room and realized that I probably didn't want to be
tripping over the mic &amp; power cables on the floor as well as the big tripod
stands. I decide to suspend the speakers from the ceiling as a way to keep the
floor uncluttered. So, I added two (switched) power outlets in the ceiling and
two mic lines wired to the performance room patch bay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1869_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I placed the switch for the ceiling mounted JBL speaker power by the door
(below) in a two gang box.&nbsp; The left switch is for the JBL's, and the right
switch I wired to a switched outlet behind where my live performance rack will
be sitting. Very close to the performance room patch bay. In theory, when I want
to jam I should just be able to walk into the room, hit the lights, power up the
live rack gear, and then the JBL's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way I have this set up, the mics in the room can either be wired to the
live rack, or to the main board for DAW recording. They just have to be
re-patched. And, there won't be any cables underfoot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/Picture_1872_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>This is kind of over the top, but I have this neon guitar that I want to hang
up over the couch. :-) Anyway, I used up the last two single gang boxes making a
switched outlet box (below) on the back wall over the couch. You can see the
switch box to the left of the breaker panel.&nbsp; It only took about 20 minutes
to add this, so it wasn't a big deal. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_1868_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>Well, that's about it for now. I don't know if I'll get any more time in this
weekend, or not. </p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I haven't written anything for a while, but I have been busy. I'm starting to
get used to the fact that with twin 6 month old babies you don't get 12 consecutive
hours to devote to anything. I wouldn't trade them for the world though! :-)
Anyway, I'm getting better at working on things in small increments and feeling
good about what I've done as opposed to feeling bad about what I didn't get
done. Besides, what's the rush?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realized that the rumble &amp; roar of the house HVAC system might be kind
of hard to squelch since it's on the other side of the storage room wall. Rather
that risk getting done and discovering that it was unacceptable, I took the time
to wire in a furnace cut-off switch to the right of the Control Room mixing
position. It's wired to the single-gang box to the right of the beam in the
picture below. It worked great! Now, if I need silence for a critical take, I
can just reach up and throw the cut-off switch.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2057_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I demolished the back wall of the left closet (that used to have the subpanel
installed on it before I realized that it was a code violation to have a
subpanel in a closet) and built a big shelf and an access hatch into the
crawlspace.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2060_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I decided to finish up the left closet since I was working in there already
and wielding a big-ass hammer.&nbsp; I built a&nbsp; false ceiling and stuffed
the space around the ductwork with about 12&quot; of insulation. These ducts
head straight into the kitchen and bonus room office, so it was important to
isolate them. Especially given the fact that, un-isolated, a small transistor
radio playing in the studio space can be heard clearly in the kitchen. The false
ceiling has 1/2&quot; MDF and/or 3/4&quot; plywood that will ultimately be
covered by 5/8&quot; sheetrock.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2061_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I finished up the wiring in the closet as well. In the crawlspace access area
I wired up the dedicated 15A breaker to two outlets, and to a switched light
socket in the ceiling.</p>
<p>I also mounted the 12V transformer for the studio access outdoor stair lights
and connected the switched power outlet for the transformer. The actual switch
is up by the entry way.&nbsp; Anyway, the stair lights worked the first time! As
you can see below the light works, and the outlets are being used now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2050_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>When the left closet was done, I moved to the right closet. I soundproofed
the ductwork coming directly out of the furnace and the DAW ISO box fan unit by
stuffing the entire space above the ISO box with insulation and adding 1/2&quot;
MDF inner walls.&nbsp; I had an urge to try out my new electric stapler, so I
stuck some insulation on the right wall of the closet. It worked pretty well.
I'll never use a hand stapler again.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2062_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I decided it was time to disconnect the umbilical cord (the old wiring from
where it was tapped into the downstairs bathroom circuit) and to run lights and
tools temporarily off of my new crawlspace outlets. It took about 4 hours to
reverse engineer the circuit and to disable it safely. I pulled down all of the fluorescent
lights, and pulled all of the wires out that I could. The guy used 14 gauge
wires, it's no wonder my table saw &amp; compressor had such a hard time
operating well when they were occupying what is slowly turning into the
studio.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2055_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2056_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>Recently, I decided to take advantage of the time in the morning while Karen
and the twins have been sleeping. In the past few mornings I have been able to
strip the outer wire jacketing for the A/C wiring in both rooms and to tuck the
wires back safely into their boxes (like below) so they won't be in the way of
the sheetrock crew's RotoZip tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2049_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I am now in the process of soundproofing the ducts (see below) that are to
the left of the entryway. I'm sound-isolating all of them from each other using
heavy hardboard dividers and insulation. The big 10&quot; duct also leads
directly into the kitchen and the bonus room office, so this is fairly
critical. You only get one shot on this stuff. Once the sheetrock is up I'm just
going to have to live with the way it all pans out.<a name="Entry Way HVAC Mess"></a></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2065_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>Well, I guess that's about it for now. Here's hoping that I get a few hours
in this weekend! :-) </p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Well, it has again been a while since I've had time to write. Karen and the
twins are still sleeping, so I'm taking advantage of the few minutes I
have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I spent about 10 hours under the floor in the crawlspace last weekend (yuck),
and three hours this weekend,&nbsp; tapping into the house HVAC system for my
two new rooms. I don't have any pictures and I don't feel like going back down
there any time soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had full access to the 10&quot; supply duct under the floor, so I just cut
the duct and inserted a &quot;Y&quot; which I then inserted a another
&quot;Y&quot;' to feed the two rooms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was no return air access, so I had to make my own. I had to punch
through the wall into the furnace room (below) and then tap into the side of the
main return air duct.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2182_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2179_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>Because I am concerned about sound from the rooms leaking back into the house
HVAC &amp; visa-versa, I inserted a home brew silencers on each of the feeds in
and out of the room. I took duct elbows and made &quot;S&quot; shaped ducts that
had no line of site and 4 turns to them. Hopefully this will help attenuate any
sound that leaks into the ducts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're wondering why the return air vent is so small, 6&quot;, well, what
I'm actually doing is connecting what was originally the 4&quot; duct&nbsp;
fresh-air exchange system into the house HVAC due to budget limitations. So,
this is actually the right size. The studio was going to have a closed system
A/C of its own, but at this point that's outside the scope of my budget.. If leakage turns out to be an unbearable problem (hopefully not)
I have full access to the ducts under the floor and can disconnect it from the
house HVAC and put it onto its own system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, when I fired up the HVAC everything worked the first time! The input
vents in each room were blowing air into the room, and the output vents were
pulling air out of the room. I also noticed that there wasn't any noise coming
from any of the vents, so perhaps my attenuation scheme, and all of the other
turns in the ducts took their toll on the furnace noise. Yes!&nbsp;</p>

<p>My two brothers, Kent and Frank, came down from Seattle to help me with the
insulation this weekend. Thanks guys! At times it seemed like I'd never get to
this point because there was always some reason that the insulation couldn't go
up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We found that the best way to cut the 6&quot; insulation is to compress it
with a straight edge, and then to use an electric meat cutting knife. It works
even better than a razor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing they did was finish the ceiling insulation in both rooms while I
was tapping into the furnace.&nbsp; Kent is admiring his work below.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2167_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>We worked together for a day and a half and got the performance room done.
It's amazing how the room has started to shrink as the insulation makes the wall
more solid. The room is really starting to take on its final shape. The guitar
nooks below actually have some depth to them now.&nbsp;I can picture them now
with 3 guitars hanging in each nook and the accent lighting in place...</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2169_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"> <img border="0" src="images/Picture_2173_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>

<p>The picture below gives you a good view of the double wall construction, the
6&quot; performance room walls have R21 insulation, and the 4&quot; control room
walls use R-15. It was handy having the double walls since the wiring just got
tacked to the back side for the most part instead of being routed through holes
drilled in each stud; what a timesaver!</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2175._small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2165_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>&nbsp;I think it
will take another full day to insulate the control room, and then I have to
square up the window frame between the two rooms.&nbsp; Due to a small warp in
the floor, the window frames didn't line up perfectly.</p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>My sister Stephanie came down for a visit and she insulated the most of
the control room while my wife and I were at the ocean celebrating our wedding
anniversary. She had mentioned that she wanted to help, but I didn't think she'd
have enough time since she was busy registering for college and looking for an
apartment. What a nice surprise to come home to that! Thanks Stephanie, you
rock! :-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, I'm getting closer to being able to call in the sheetrock crew. I can
picture the room now with the rounded bull nose corners and texturing and the
maple Pergo flooring in place. It's going to be nice!&nbsp; I've actually
started to look at paint color schemes. </p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>It's been a while since I've written; about 4 months. Yikes! How time flies
...</p>
<p>I insulated what was left of the Control Room, which was the entryway.&nbsp;
It's looking pretty good now that <a href="#Entry Way HVAC Mess">the HVAC
stuff</a> is hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2753_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I did a lot of work at the interface (below) between the two rooms: the
double-door frame and the window frame. The window frames were not lined up and
wouldn't work, so I made inner frames and reduced the <a href="#Older Window Frame">pre-existing
window</a> size from 3' by 5', to 28&quot; by 52&quot;. So, I can either used
plate glass, or buy some stock 2' by 4' vinyl frames. I weather sealed between
the two frames using soft foam tape. So, hopefully It will help
minimize/eliminate moisture problems between the panes of glass.&nbsp; It's
probably better to have a smaller window anyway, less sound leakage will
result.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2736_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I also finished the door frame between the two rooms (above) using 3/4&quot;
MDF and foam tape. So, the two rooms are not touching except at the foam and
some light insulation. I also had to work around the natural gas line and the
laminated beam holding up the garage, that's the plywood box above the window.</p>
<p>There is also another natural gas line above the window running perpendicular
to the window. There was no way I was going to try and move it, so I built a box
(see above and below) around it. This will look like a shallow simulated beam running
across the room. Since I thought would look kind of goofy, I added a mirror
image fake simulated bean tot he left of the window. The window is centered
under them. I'm currently thinking I will stick some kind of sound control foam
in-between them.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2759_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I just realized that I never stuck up and overview of the floor plan, here it
is. I didn't fuss too much with the picture once I could see what I needed to
get the job done. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Great%20Room%20Concept%20Final.jpg" width="825" height="722"></p>
<p>Anyway, it's really starting to look kind of cool with the insulation up and
the walls being more defined.</p>
<p>Here's some images of the Performance Room starting with a look through the
double-doors and looking&nbsp; counter-clockwise around the room. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2741_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2743_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2744_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2745_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2746_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>Here's a view of the control room that you didn't see in the most recently
added images:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2757_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I'm ready for the sheetrock now, finally!!!! I just called three different
sheetrock contractors and will have quotes in-hand shortly. </p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p>I picked a contractor and they came out this past weekend. They put up the
soundboard &amp; 5/8&quot; sheetrock walls in the control room, and the three
layer MDF + Sound Board + 5/8&quot; Sheetrock walls in the performance room.
Boy, did they fly! With all the layers I wanted it was the equivalent of rocking
a 2500 ft^2 house. Four guys worked for two days, and they got it done. They'll
be out some time this coming week to add the rounded corner bull-nose and then
taping and mudding.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have a few pictures to share.&nbsp; Here's a shot of the entryway. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2863_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"> </p>
<p>Here's a picture of the mixing position.&nbsp; The facade above the window
coving the laminated beam and natural gas line turned out really good! The two
parallel fake beams turned out well too. The one on the right hides another gas
line, and the one on the left is just there for symmetry.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2838_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"> </p>
<p>Here's a shot inside the Performance Room that shows the Guitar Nooks.&nbsp;
I had to work around two ducts in the top and the HVAC duct along the bottom.
They run the full length of the wall. It's kind of cool that I was able to
recover what would have been wasted space if I'd made the wall vertical. If you
look closely you can see the light fixture boxes in each bay that I can use for
accent lighting. I'm thinking it would be cool to have just the bays glowing and
no other light on in the room to set a mood.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2848_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>Here's a different picture of the rear of the Performance Room.&nbsp; That's
my old couch from my apartment all covered in plastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2842_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>Well, I should go, I'll write more later when something changes. </p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The sheetrock guys came back the following weekend and applied the corner
bull-nose, taped,&nbsp; and mudded everything. I stuck a 1500W oil filled space
heater in there. I left the door open for a while each day to let the moisture
out.&nbsp; They came back two more times during the week to sand and re-apply
the compound. IT took one more coat than they were used to. The taped seams
*really* pulled in as it dried. I'm guessing that it had something to do with
the fact that the soundboard (basically paper) was right behind it working like
a sponge. When I saw this happening I cranked the heat up to 90 degrees and let
it bake for 7 days straight. Those sheets of soundboard had been sitting in the
garage for 16 months, so hopefully that drove the moisture out of them.</p>
<p>Here's some pics of the walls just after the texturing was applied. It's
starting to look really good!&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2901_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2902_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I had some free time this past Sunday, so I applied the white primer/sealer
to the performance room walls. Wow! All of the seams disappeared, check it out! </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2939_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2940_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_2941_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I don't want it to look like an operating room, so now I'm going to have to
seriously contemplate paint colors. </p>
<p>My hydronic heaters arrived by UPS last week along with their Honeywell
programmable thermostats; cool! </p>
<p>I also made a run out to Home Depot and bought all of the track lighting. So,
I have everything I need to do the A/C wiring upstairs in the garage. </p>
<p>The door company got back to me with a really good quote for the custom
height doors (all 7 of them), and I'm placing the order with them some time
today. </p>
<p>I'm looking forward to my week off over Thanksgiving when they shut ELDEC
down. I should have enough to keep me very busy. :-) </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p>Looking at my last entry, I see that it was November, yikes! Time is flying
right by me ... Well, I've actually accomplished a lot since then, I just didn't
have time to write.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So, the first thing I did was paint the Performance room ceiling flat white
put up the track lighting.&nbsp; My sister Stephanie painted the other room's
ceiling white and I got all of&nbsp; the lights up and working in both rooms. It
was nice to finally get rid of all of the&nbsp; temporary lighting.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then, my brother Kent, and sister Stephanie and I painted the Performance
Room walls with three coats of plum eggshell paint.&nbsp; I felt that the plum was
a warmer, more creative color. I didn't want it to look like a brilliant white
surgical ward.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At that point I was able to grind through getting the rest of the A/C wiring
done in that room.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here's a picture of the room at this point: </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_3268_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>The back wall of the guitar nooks are color-matched with the gray&nbsp; panel
absorbers I will be sticking up on the walls. Eventually it'll look more color
balanced.&nbsp; Right now the gray just kind of stick out. I think it'll turn
out OK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Control Room, I decided not to use the track lighting. Instead I put
up three brushed metal lights like you see below:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_3284_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I decided to paint the Control Room the same color, starting with the entry
way below.&nbsp; I used the same gray accent color that I used for the back of
the nooks for the entry way inside wall for balance reasons.</p>
<p>I installed a brushed metal wall sconce since the ceiling is so low in the
entryway.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_3286_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I got the left closet (below) done. I'm just going to leave the insides of
the closet painted with the white primer since it looks OK as-is. I had never
done flooring or baseboards before, so I tried it in the back of this closet. It
looks pretty good, and Rachel likes it!&nbsp; </p>
<p>As you can see, I also installed and trimmed out the door to the crawlspace. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4284_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>Then I got the door to the DAW box installed and trimmed out. It works really
well. I have been adding door bumpers everywhere so the wall won't get trashed. When
I turn on the fan motor and close the door I can't even hear it running.
So, hopefully I won't hear my DAW too much. &lt;crossed fingers&gt;.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_3884_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>Stephanie and I then put on three coats of the plumb paint in the control
room. As you can see it's looking pretty good.&nbsp; As soon as the paint was
dry I hooked up all of the A/C wiring including the thermostats. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_3882_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>Tormay came down for a visit and to work on our CD. Before he left he helped
me move the big built-in cabinet on the left below.&nbsp; Thanks Tormay! The
roll of carpeting you see in the right hand closet is destined to be lining in the DAW box.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_3886._smalljpg.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>My brother Kent helped me put in the Pergo flooring in the performance room.
As you can see it looks pretty good.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_3864_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to putting in the floor, I installed the solid core double doors. I
still have the scars from that. One of them fell over and hit my leg.
OUCH!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I finally installed the Hydronic baseboard heaters too. The two
heaters, one per room, can heat the studio from 50 degrees to 80 degrees in less
than an hour. Not too shabby.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_3871_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>Then I trimmed the door out and installed the baseboards. I used the air nail
gun, so as you can see,&nbsp; I now have 10,000 nail holes puttied up that need
to be painted over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out my window frame! I used my new router bits and made it look really
decent. I just ordered the 1/2&quot; plate glass this morning. It'll be here
next Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4260_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>Here's another shot that shows how the room is shaping up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4255_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4278_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>You can see my new set of Mapex drums above. I need to move the couch so I can
actually put everything where it belongs. It was a real bargain on eBay at 1/3
of retail, and it was new. The kit was a last years scratch/dent model,
but the one tiny scratch is totally covered by the bass drum head when you put
it on.. The kit is
supposed to be designed for studio recording, as are the hand-hammered Istanbul
cymbals and hi-hats. So,
even though I don't play the drums (yet) I could use it for recording if I can
get a drummer in the studio.&nbsp; Wait a minute! I think I have one! :-) Of course I'll need enough mic inputs, so
it'll have to wait a while.&nbsp; I will wire up the overheads right away
though. </p>
<p>I finally got around to lining the DAW ISO box (below) with the automotive
carpeting. It looks great! And as an added bonus, it now has that &quot;new car
smell&quot;. :-) In the ceiling you can see the exhaust fan, on the back wall
the computer power and internet connections, and on the left floor the two
conduit cable grommets where the mouse, keyboard, SVGA, and fiber optical audio
cables will go.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4286_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I have started ordering the long lead time stuff on ebay. I have the 30'
optical cables for the A/D &amp; D/A boxes, the keyboard mouse cables, the 30 Ft
SVGA cables, and a CAT-5 USB extender that will me to wire up the control
surface and anything else USB at my desk.&nbsp; My office is starting to look
like an electronics superstore. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4297_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"> </p>
<p>I got a cool 0.7 W (pardon the pun) running LED lamp (below) for the ISO booth from Karen's
brother Steven. It screws right into my existing fixture that will help keep the
temperature down when someone is in the booth.&nbsp; I'm going to get
another one, for the other socket, and a third one for the piano light if I can.
In the picture below I just have it screwed into a temporary socket and plugged
into the top of one of the guitar nooks. Steven is going to get me a deal on
some square super-bright LED rope. That's what I'll have in the guitar nooks concealed
behind some trim.&nbsp; It'll look cool since it will provide just enough light
to highlight the guitars.
</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4283_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I also managed to finagle seven more EMP-1 preamps on eBay for a song. I
don't think that people know just how good they really are.&nbsp; But, that's to
my advantage.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4293_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>They had free shipping for some of the heavier drum parts if I went over a
certain $ limit, so I used it as an opportunity to get some extra
headphones.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4294_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I also have a pair the Studio Projects B-1 vocal mics on back-order right now
too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I'd better get going. Reality is calling me, and it's using a baby
monitor!!</p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Finally! I got the window done (below). Stephanie helped me lift in the last
1/2&quot; sheet which was the picky part since I didn't want to seal in any
finger prints, dust, basically a dirty window. After double checking and triple
checking we dropped it into place. I had pre-cut, drilled, and fit all of the
boards that hold the window in, so it went together like a jigsaw puzzle.&nbsp;
The air gap between the two 1/2&quot; sheets is 5-1/2&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4644_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I custom built a black rubber gasket between the two walls out of a garage
door seal. I sealed everything with silicon as I went. I use gold door seal trim
to trap the gasket in place. You can see some of the detail below.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4640_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>With the window done, I moved onto placing he absorbers on the rear wall. I
used L brackets and spaced them 1/2&quot; off the wall.&nbsp; I could hear the
difference immediately.&nbsp; The room is still too live, but it sounded much
better.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4645_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>The UPS man delivered the mic stands &amp; booms arrived last week. I'm going
to mount them inverted from the ceiling just like I did in the vocal
booth.&nbsp; I got the 1/4 turn latch hex-base units so if I want to make room I
can quickly pop the stand off of the base.</p>
<p>The two Studio Project's B-1 mics showed up as well. What beautiful mics! The
craftsmanship is great, and the sound is amazing. I think it's on Par with my
more expensive Audio Technica mic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stuck a Sony DVD +/- R/W drive in my music PC last week too. Another great
eBay deal. It is compatible with he Samplitude Master program, and it burned a
copy of our CD in about 2 minutes flat; wow! The guy that bought it originally
only used it a few time and then he bought a Dell system that had one
integrated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as I sand and paint the trim (just the nail holes) in the Performance
room I'm going to clean it up really well and move in my instruments; maybe as
soon as next week! Woo Hoo! At least one of the rooms will be usable. </p>
<p>I guess that's about it for now. </p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Well, have I been busy!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I got the trim all cleaned up and painted in the performance room, and it
looks really nice.&nbsp; I also cleaned all of the hard surfaces with a vacuum
and some cleanser to get rid of the construction dirt/dust. </p>
<p>I pulled the plastic off (it had been 3 years) the sleeper couch, and steam
cleaned it with the carpet machine. I got lucky, it was cool and dry down there,
so there was no mold or rotting. When I moved it into it's designated spot in
the room, it fit perfectly. It should make a nice Bass Trap too since it's up
against the wall and has a big mattress in it. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4898_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>&nbsp; The cheap hangers I bought would have allowed the guitars to bounce
off the wall, so I built up some guitar hanger wall plates and screwed them to
the wall really well. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/Picture_4882_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>So, you can see I now have all of my guitars in the room! Woo Hoo! It's kind
of distracting when I'm trying to get work done. I keep finding myself in there
playing instead of working on the studio. But, isn't that the point anyway? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4893_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_4891_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>With the guitars up, I moved on to wiring some of the wall plates and making
custom cables.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_5089_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>I put up the drum overheads using an inverted table stand and an adjustable
boom. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_5091_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>Then I drilled and mounted two mic stands inverted and made more cables. I
stuck two adjustable booms on them, one with a Studio projects B-1 for vocals
and a Oktava MC012 for guitars.&nbsp; These stands have 1/4 turn quick release
bases on them, so if need be, they can come down in seconds. But, I don't see
that happening too much, even the hide-a-bed will open without taking them down.
</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_5093_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I'm still not done with the wiring, but Kent came over, so we worked on the
floor in the Control Room.&nbsp; I had to work around a floor with a big dip in
it, but I was able to make it work.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_5094_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"><img border="0" src="images/Picture_5095_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>I was having fun working the flooring around the in-floor power and audio
boxes. Then it dawned on me I had a new router bit in my arsenal that would do
the trick; it did! </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_5088_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>I still have along way to go, but it's looking better and better every week.
:-) </p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Well, I got the baseboards up everywhere in the Control Room.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/Picture_5910_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/Picture_5911_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>

<p>If you look above carefully you can see that I finally worked out the details
of the dual doors. Here's a better picture. I used the same rubber gasket
material that I used to seal the window and then trapped it in place with some
white trim pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_5908_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>

<p>I also built the closet bi-fold door frames in-place because I couldn't buy
then pre-hung. They turned out pretty good. I had to make the door narrower by
1/2&quot; in order to clear the right wall, but that didn't take long on the
table saw!&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_5909_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>

<p>I managed to locate the right hangers for my EON speakers on eBay for $40
instead of $150; and they were new. So, I bought them and suspended the speakers
using steel cables. I used quick-release latches so if I want to take
them down for some reason it won't be a big ordeal. The room feels bigger to me
without the big tripods in the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_5696_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_5702_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>

<p>I picked up some Formica for the built-in cabinet last week, and the wood for
a new door and matching hinges. I tore off the existing Formica and I'm plugging
up the hole that was intended for a sink. </p>

<p>Today at lunch I bought the solid maple stair bullnose material, so I can get
started on the entryway too. </p>

<p>I almost forgot ... I got a new drummer! (Ha Ha)&nbsp; Check out those teeth!
Ryan and Rachel have named the Studio the &quot;Boom Boom Room!&quot;. They
stand at the top of the stairs yelling, &quot;Dad-Da! ... Dad-Da! ... Boom Boom
Boom! Boom Boom Boom!&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_5707_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>

<p>But wait! There's more ...&nbsp;</p>

<p>I picked up an 8 channel headphone preamp for my rack, and four pairs of Vic
Firth high-isolation (24 dB) headphones. They have the Sony MDR-7506 ( what I
have in the ISO booth now) innards, so they sound really decent.&nbsp; I also
grabbed a Feedback Destroyer for the PA, I'm not holding my breath, but it might
help.</p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Well, the Feedback destroyer worked better than expected. Not great, but now
I can use the PA&nbsp; I can
actually crank the gain quite a bit before feedback now. Cool!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had a babysitter for 4 hours while Karen was in California, so I tackled
the built-in cabinet problem. I cut a hole in the front with my router,
built/installed a matching door, plugged the sink-hole with some plywood, and
then laminated on the new Formica and trimmed it with my laminate flush-cut
router bit. It turned out really good; I had never done Formica before. I even
got it in-place and screwed into the wall. I still need to finish the new door
so it matches the rest. Then, I'll put some cabinet trim around the edge to
clean it up. If I can't find any color-matched pre-finished trim, I'll just use
white. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_5933_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6030_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>It's been months since I've written anything. Time is sure flying. Rachel and
Ryan just had their second birthday here on Thanksgiving.&nbsp; I took them to
Guitar Center the other day and they found two small mic stands with boom arms
that were sitting side by side that were the perfect height for them. They
proceeded to sing (in stereo) into the mic boom ends, &quot;Crinkle crinkle....
Star! E-I-E-I-O! Ow I won-der... Are!&quot;. It was pretty funny. The apple
doesn't fall too far from the tree, eh?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I finally got the entry way done.&nbsp; With a lot of effort I was able to
notch the solid maple bullnose and cut it to make the step like a big picture
frame. Being picky paid off as the Pergo just slipped right in. It worked out
really well.&nbsp; I stuck a big metal plate at the top of the door (I'll
probably do the bottom too) where the upper bolt goes into the door frame with
big 3&quot; screws into the 2X6's to make the door more secure.&nbsp; I have a
new lock and deadbolt that I will put on shortly.&nbsp; Kent and Stephanie
helped me re-finish the outer doors before the weather turned cold. I replaced
the door seals too. I just need to do some inside trim around the double doors
and above the step and I'm done.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6028_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>

<p>Ryan wanted to hang out in the studio the other day, we had a great time!
:-)&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6258_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>When he saw the shop vacuum he got very excited and proceed to say,
&quot;Shop vacuum, find it! Missed it!&quot;&gt; He then walked over and turned
it on and started cleaning the floor for me yelling, &quot;Dirt! Suck it up!
Dirt! Suck it up!&quot;. When he was done he said, &quot;All done! Unplug
it!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6266_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I got a great deal on a Shure Beta 52A kick drum mic on eBay and set that up
in the Performance room.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6309_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I finally decided it was time to have &quot;moving day&quot; in spite of the
fact that I wasn't quite done. Kent helped me move the ISO booth into it's new
home; it fit perfectly! :-)</p>
<p>.<img border="0" src="images/Picture_6317_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>Then we moved in all of my rack gear and the computer desk. As I knew it
would, the 21&quot; monitor is blocking my window I worked so hard to
build.&nbsp; I'll probably get some new shielded powered monitor speakers and
hack-saw off the upper part of the desk and build little stands for the
speakers.&nbsp; That will lower the monitor about 18&quot; and make the window
usable. It'll also take care of the problem of the speakers being too close to
the wall with rear facing bass ports if I find new monitors with front facing
ports. I currently considering the Event TR8N monitors.&nbsp; I fixed the chair
below too with a piece of aluminum bar stock, so I don't have to buy a new
one.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6318_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>Next I moved in the DAW computer into it's new ISO machine closet home. It
fit perfectly, so I routed all analog and optical cables under the floor using
the conduits I had in place. That worked out really well too. The computer fired
right up and worked great from the remote ISO booth and the main console.&nbsp;
You can't hear the computer at all&nbsp; when the solid core door is closed
*and* it runs cooler that ever! :-). I let it run all day after I initially
hooked it up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/Picture_6313_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>Then I realized I could hook up my good Dahlquist home stereo speakers in the
performance room, so I did! They worked right out of the gate. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6302_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I finally got around to rearranging my rack to hold the new hardware I got on
eBay.&nbsp; I currently have 8 channels of Class-A preamps (EMP-1) and 24
channels of analog input (AD24). To save money I'll probably just use the Mackie
&quot;direct out&quot; feature for the&nbsp; conga mics, tom drum mics, bass
direct box, and RP-10 outputs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have eBay bids in for a few more EMP-1's. If&nbsp; I win them, then the
following mics will be on the good preamps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The vocal &amp; guitar mics in the ISO both<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The left performance room performer vocal &amp; guitar mics<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The right performance room performer vocal &amp; guitar
mics<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The drum overheads<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The kick drum mic<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The snare drum mic</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6324_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>For now, only the two ISO booth mics are even hooked up.&nbsp; I probably
going to gut the rack and star over, it's a nightmare and really I don't&nbsp;
think I need the patch bay any more. </p>
<p>I finally wired the last built-in wiring wall-plate. I have been keeping
myself busy making cables to save money. I can make a cable for $4 that rivals
the $40 cables at Guitar Center. I bought a small microprocessor based cable
tester, and set up shop. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6321_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>Last weekend I started setting up the Performance room for solo practicing by
making a custom bracket for my old SR16 drum machine that clamps to my music
stand. It worked out really well, so I wired it to the PA.&nbsp; I'm going to
make a small riser for the floor to stick my RP-10 guitar processor on that will
get it up high enough for me to reach, and for the SR16 foot pedals. If I do it
right I can coil up the excess audio and power cables/wall-warts underneath it. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6307_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>Well, I guess that's about it for now.&nbsp; </p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I haven't written for a while, but I have been busy!&nbsp; I made so many
custom cables I was pretty tired of making them by the time I was done.&nbsp;
Almost all of the cables in the recording path are hand made Star Quad, and they
sound awesome!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made the decision to eliminate the patch bays (and associated spaghetti
wiring) since I was just going to use the analog path for monitoring.&nbsp;
I&nbsp; removed all of the *miles* (ha ha) of substandard Hosa cable snakes and
completely gutted the left had rack.&nbsp; I added more power strips for the new
preamps and routed the power wires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made a quick spreadsheet of all the inputs and realized that strangely
enough the SR2404 didn't have enough inputs. So, I looked around eBay and found
a used rack mount LM3204 line mixer for $200 which I used to sub-mix monitors of
all of the preamp outputs in the rack itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6409_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>It took a few hours (well worth it) to carefully label every mixer channel
input, headphone output, and preamp so I can keep things straight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6408_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>As you can see below, the wiring cleaned up nicely. All the wires are just the
right length.&nbsp; Since I only had 10 EMP-1 preamps, I opted to make special
Mackie Insert point cables that I connected directly to the AD24 inputs.&nbsp;
By just used the preamp this cut out most of the mixer's internal path for
recording and worked out surprisingly well.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6413_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>I had a stereo pair of Oktava MC-012's in the ISO booth, but decided to
replace them with a pair of Shure BG 4.0 mics that I had laying around in a
box.&nbsp; The Oktavas sounded too much like my Neumann, so I decided why have
them in the ISO booth if it doesn't sound different enough? Besides, I always
liked the guitar sound I got with the Shure mics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I found myself with a pair of MC-012's freed up, and decided to stick
them over the congas and dedicate two channels to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6398_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>&nbsp;I got a great deal on a set of used (1 year old) Audix drum mics for
the toms and the snare drum. These are pro quality mics and I got them for about
25% the cost of new. When they arrived I got some mounting clips and set them up
on the drum kit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6405_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>In the picture below you can see all of the 7 mics on the kit if you look
carefully.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6406_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>When had I routed the last wire (YES!!!) I started SONAR and carefully
checked out each signal and set each input's gain to avoid clipping. I also set
up a starting point for the Mackie headphone mix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was shocked at the sonic improvement!! The recording paths are all
pristine, there's no hum or anything. This includes the in-wall/floor wiring. It
seems to have paid off using the best cable I could reasonably afford and being
careful to route the A/C wires as far from the mic cables as possible. I also
crossed power and signal wires at right angles when I had to cross them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last weekend I loaded SONAR 3, patched it, then loaded SONAR 4, and patched
it to the latest revision&nbsp; too.&nbsp; I upgraded the Radikal control
surface firmware too.&nbsp; I did a test in SONAR 4 that recorded 24 mic/line
inputs simultaneously at 24 bits and the hard drive usage meter was about 7% and
the CPU % at about 10%, so it's useable!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also created a first cut of a SONAR 4 template for the studio that has all
of the inputs named, assigned, and routed to busses and outputs.&nbsp; So, now
when I start up SONAR and create a new project it's all ready to go! Cool!&nbsp;</p>
<p>17&quot; LCD Monitors have finally hit the $199 mark at Costco, so I may
replace my big 21&quot; behemoth with two smaller monitors. If I do that, I will
be finally able to look through the window between the two room that I worked so
hard to build, and I will be able to plug a guitar in and record it at the
console w/o picking up any hum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what's left in the construction department? Not too much, one good
weekend and I could be done.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Misc. Trim Work</li>
  <li>Hanging 2 Closet Doors</li>
  <li>Some Minor Touchup Paint</li>
  <li>Installing the new lock and deadbolt on the entry doors.</li>
</ul>
<p>What's left in other departments? </p>
<ul>
  <li>Wrapping up the live sound wiring for jamming, it's about 75% done. </li>
  <li>Acoustical treatment for both rooms. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="The Twins"></a></p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I haven't had a lot of time lately. But, I did manage to get something done
in spite of that fact!&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The closet doors are installed and working.</li>
  <li>The Entryway door is all trimmed out and painted.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Touchup painting is all done, and the damage done when moving the ISO
    booth in has been repaired.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>I installed a bookshelf over the built-in cabinet, and moved all of my
    music related books into the studio.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>I bought all of the trim that I need for around the built-in cabinet</li>
</ul>
<p>I had to deal with a faulty Mackie LM3204 mixer. I had been blaming my PC for
the odd behavior, but investigation showed that the Mackie mixer I bought to submix
signals for the headphone mix was flaking out.&nbsp; So, I bought another one on
eBay from a guy who was upgrading a bunch of corporate conference rooms. This
one was barely used, and worked perfectly.&nbsp; The seller of the defective
unit refunded my money in full once he tried the unit himself even though it was
two months post-purchase and outside of his normal 15 day return window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally replaced my old 21&quot; monitor with three 19&quot; ProView LCD
monitors.&nbsp; Staples had them on sale for a price that was so low it was hard
to believe. I think they were blowing out analog monitor inventory so they could
bring in the new digital monitors.&nbsp; My 4 port video card drives analog
monitors, so that wasn't a problem. Unfortunately, when they arrived, I found
out that the monitor cables were molded into the monitor, so my extension cables
would plug in. I had a heck of time locating gender benders, but finally did
find them locally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they finally arrived it was clear that my existing steel/glass studio
desk would not work, so I modified my oak office desk and swapped desks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I turned a spare oak bookcase shelf into an extra wide keyboard drawer</li>
  <li>I built stands for the monitors which I fastened to the desk with
    screws.&nbsp; I used soft pine, rounded the edges, and stained it
    &quot;honey oak&quot; so it would be a stand-off match for the desk.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>I also drilled a hole in the platform so I could hide the speaker wires. (
    You can actually see the back side of the desk from Performance Room through
    the window)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>I bought a set of Auralex foam &quot;Mo Pads&quot; to isolate the monitors
    from the desk and to angle them properly.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6688_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6690_small.jpg" width="396" height="594"></p>
<p>Here's a picture up close at the mixing position, pretty cool!&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6682_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>Here's how it looks when you back up a bit; pretty clean!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Picture_6681_small.jpg" width="594" height="396"></p>
<p>The is desk has a nice big shelf underneath it. So, that's a plus! And, it's
not see through like the other one, so you see less of the rats-nest of wires
than you used to.&nbsp; I can now look through the big window into the
Performance Room that I spent so much time and energy building. </p>

<p><a name="Nine Years Later"></a> </p>
<p>Wow ... It has been like ... LITERALLY 9 years since my last rambling update
...&nbsp; :-) In the past nine years a few things have changed. </p>
<p>As they say, time flies when you're having fun!&nbsp; I formed a band and
actually spent a lot of time _using_ the studio. </p>
<p>About 4 years ago my venerable Sonorus AD24 optical converter units started
to bite the dust, I got tired of the rain dance I had to perform in order to
get them all synched up and grew weary of the random channels that went dead
following power-up. I usually found out about these right after the best take
ever. </p>
<p>So, I upgraded to 32 channels of M-Audio ACTANE light pipe converters. They
are very transparent, but sadly have buzzing issues with low impedence mics
which is most of my collection. &lt;sigh&gt; Nevertheless, they still work
really well, but I have to let them warm up for about 15 minutes before a
recording session. Pretty ludicrous, but acceptable since all channels work,
there are no synch issues, and they sound great! Here they are in all their
glory. </p>

<p>My 10 year old old DAW (below) has seen better days, it's been moved out of its
machine closet and the migration to the new DAW is almost complete. It is
destined for the boneyard, or perhaps it will live again as a replacement for our
media server which is even older!&nbsp;Look at that case, it's the size of a
refrigerator!&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>.<img border="0" src="images/2014-04-16-20.47.gif" width="512" height="384"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I built up the new DAW (below) and hand picked the parts, it ended up being quite
the overkill, but I'm an engineer so ... enough said! </p>
<blockquote>

<p>I finally eliminated a 10 year old rats-nest of cables and drives in the
machine closet by adding a shelf. I made a &quot;skateboard&quot; for the DAW
and now I can actually work on it in-place if I need to open the hood, it just
rotates. It used to be a major ordeal.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights of the new DAW: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A recent motherboard that still had two *real* legacy PCI slots
    (not simulated) for my high end optical audio cards. </li>
  <li>A screamingly fast i7-3930K 6 Core Processor clock up to 4 GHz.</li>
  <li>The best air cooler I could find. </li>
  <li>32 GB of fast RAM.</li>
  <li>1.25 TB of SSD drives. </li>
  <li>4 TB of 7200 RPM SATA drive for videography and backups. </li>
  <li>A Blu-Ray burner. </li>
  <li>Dual video cards resulting in four outputs.</li>
  <li>A TI chip based FireWire card for connections to my legacy video cameras
    and new Presonus 16.4.2 mixer</li>
  <li>Win 7 Professional&nbsp;x64</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see from the screeen shot below it is &quot;loaded for bear&quot;.

<p>The initial tests have been promising.&nbsp; Songs that would barely play on
my old dual core system because it was maxed out at 90% CPU are running with
only
4% to 6 % CPU utilization. I love it when&nbsp; plan comes together! DVD videos
that used to take 9 hours to render take 15 minutes; wow! </p>
<p>Even the software upgrades have been quite the ordeal, I had paid for 5 years
of upgrades to my software to stay current, but had never installed it due to
the lack of time. During that time plug-in standards changed, as did most of the
interfaces. I have my work cut out for me.&nbsp; I was able to find XML based
work-around that allowed me to salvage my prized rough mix song template.&nbsp;
However, it's mostly a go-forward plan, resurrecting older recordings will mean
some serious grunt work needs to be done before they'll even play. </p>
<p>Since I was changing everything I decided to ditch the 3 old 18&quot; and one
17&quot; LCD
screens because they were too small, and their backlighting was failing and
inconsistent which made them hard to read. I replaced them with four new Asus
24&quot; LED displays. </p>

<p>Three of the displays are on a triple monitor stand at my main desk mixing
position. </p>

<p>The fourth monitor is in the isolation booth so I can drive the DAW when I'm
tracking vocals with the band, or if I'm the only one in the studio and
recording myself. </p>

<p>I was about to retire my old motorized fader control surface (below) because
they no longer support it and there are no USB drivers available period for Win
7. On a whim I grabbed MIDI cables and configured the surface for Mackie
emulation mode. I was blown away! After years of struggling with the flakey USB
direct interface locking up my PC, the Mackie interface was rock solid! YES!!! There's a lot to be
said for hands on mixing, and motorized faders are just cool! </p>

</blockquote>
<p>What else is new? On the live sound front I upgraded my PA, it now has a
Presonus 16.4.2 digital mixer which allows us to track 16 channels to my VAIO
all-in-wonder PC during gigs; tracks that can later be imported in the DAW and
mixed! The PA also sports a DBX PA processor and four channels of DBX feedback
suppressions on the mics. I carefully labelled everything to avoid confusion
during setup, and I now have saved gig setup templates on the mixer istelf and
on my VAIO PC.&nbsp; </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I also stopped using paper binders for my cheat sheets; gone are the clothes pins
used to keep sheets from blowing away or pages from turning. I
have a new 24&quot; Sony VAIO all-in-winder touchpad PC.&nbsp; I built a stand for it that
holds all of my gear pre-wired and ready to rock and roll - literally.&nbsp; It
only needs power and has outputs for my guitar DSP and vocals. The bands WiFi
router is in this rig too, when connected to the new Presonus Mixer we can all
connect and change our unique monitor mixes via iPads.&nbsp; We can even set up
for a gig, play a few tunes, then put our instruments down and walk out in front
with the iPad and fine tune the FOH mix. Pretty cool!&nbsp; The computer streams
each channel back through the mixer individually as if we were playing. </p>

<p>If you look above you can see foot pedals, I wired them to a USB interface
and I use them to turn song pages as I'm singing. I used Adobe Acrobat Pro to
create PDF &quot;binders&quot; which turned out to be a really slick solution. I
can turn pages and switch songs in the binder. As BSOD insurance I still bring
paper copies though, better safe that sorry. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/2014-04-16-17.43.gif" width="512" height="384"></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The stand also includes a four way HDMI splitter, so as we are learning songs
we can all see the lyrics/chords, it also comes in handy live to jog everyone's
memory as we count in. It's extremely nice when someone asks for a song we
haven't played in forever and a day and did not practice leading up to a gig. </p>

<p>Want to hear a funny story? The touchscreen worked flawlessly until we had a
night gig by a swimming pool. The water and the lights attracted bugs which were
landing on my screen during songs.&nbsp; What a nightmare! Windows faithfully
registered multi-touch events and as the bugs walked owards each other
everything shrank too small to be readable and as they walked away from each
other the font was insanely large. I even witnessed a few select and copy events
in Adobe. At the time it wasn't so funny ... I was stressed but still had a
sense of humor, I remember thinking, &quot;Use the FARCE Eric, use the
FARCE&quot; and somewhere in the way back of my mind the chords and lyrics were
actually there all along.&nbsp; Needless to say I have since figured out how to
disable all touch features for outside gigs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We have also added some DMX LED lighting&nbsp; to the fray, my son Ryan (age
11)&nbsp; does all of the lighting and set up the software for us on my wife
Karen's laptop. They are hanging on my PVC tubing transport rack, I came up with
that solution after they almost self destructed in transport to their first gig,
they look solid but are actually fragile. Someday I'll go wireless, oh yes ...
oh yes, </p>

<p>When Ryan is into it he'll sit there and interactively switch between patches
he programmed which is awesome, and when he is not he'll leave it on autopilot.
He blew his 5th grade teachers away this year when he offered to provide a
background light show for their 2001 a Space Odyssey based performance.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It sure beats our previous christmas tree lights based solution!</p>

<p>Also new is my custom &quot;Power Snake&quot; which is the glue that binds
everything together.&nbsp; All audio and power cables are good to go, shrink
tubed, in braided sleeving, and labeled. </p>

  <p>We just dump it out and it fans into and &quot;H&quot; pattern and everyone
  plugs in. Even HDMI video monitors and powered audio monitors have signal and
  power for each player. This is the result of a very long &quot;lost
  weekend&quot;. :-) I have to say, it was worth every minute invested. Our
  setup time used to be a confusing 90 minutes or more where we strugged to
  remember how things were hooked up last time, and now we can be playing in
  about 20 minutes if we hustle. </p>

    <p>I also added a Dell docking bay connected to all three wrap-around
    screens and a KVM so I can connect my laptop if need be. </p>
