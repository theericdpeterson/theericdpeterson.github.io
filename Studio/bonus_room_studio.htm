<p>Here is a picture looking at one end of my studio (15' by 25') and the ISO
booth we built in my workshop:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is 5' W by 7' D by 7'-9&quot; tall.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>It is covered in automotive carpeting.</li>
  <li>It is portable, it breaks apart into 5 pieces.</li>
  <li>It has a remote control console for the DAW.</li>
  <li>We lined it lined with 3&quot; acoustic foam.</li>
  <li>We stuck a combo bass/trap/diffuser in the ceiling.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>If you look inside you can see the microphone booms, the remote DAW console
on the right.</p>

<p>Here's a better shot of the remote console:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I made a carpet covered stand.</li>
  <li>I used a Princeton Graphics 17&quot; LCD display.</li>
  <li>I used a wireless RF Netsurf Pro keyboard</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good shot of the microphone booms too:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you look carefully, you'll see that the microphone booms are suspended
    from the ceiling,&nbsp;<br>
    that eliminated the normal rats nest of wires and stands around my feet.</li>
  <li>I use the AT-4033 in there for vocals.</li>
  <li>I use the Neumann KM-184 and Oktava MC-012's for guitars. </li>
</ul>

<p>This is a picture looking into one corner of the studio. You can see my
little live practice rig which I built from the remains of my pre-internal DAW
mixing rack gear. The stuff had been sitting idle for years until I built the
small rack in my woodshop and bought a small mixer for it. </p>
<p>I built the sound panels to deaden the room. The panels have a wooden frame,
filled with fiberglass, and are covered with headliner material.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The panel on the far wall by the door is for the alarm system complete with
motion detectors and door/window sensors.</p>
